# Destiny Fragment Viewer

Very quick and dirty site for checking off the Calcified Fragments in Destiny.

Requires Node.js, tested against v4.1.1.

How to:

```
npm install
npm start
```

View and your browser at `http://localhost:7777/{platform}/{displayName}`. For example, mine is `http://localhost:7777/{platform}/{displayName}`.

Your milage may vary - I'm probably not going to support this much or at all.
